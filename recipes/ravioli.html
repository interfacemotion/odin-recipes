    <h1>Four Cheese Ravioli</h1>
    <img src="ravioli.jpg" alt="four cheese ravioli">
    <p style="font-size: 18px">This homemade ravioli recipe includes a pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara. 
        I wanted to recreate the ravioli dish that you get at Maggiano's italian 
        restaurant and it turned out great! Don't be intimidated by the large list
        of ingredients, it is well worth it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul><b>For the dough: </b>All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water and olive oil</ul>
        <ul><b>For the filling: </b>Ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, 
                an egg and dried parsley</ul>
        <ul><b>For the sauce: </b>Olive oil, garlic, preepared basil pesto sauce 
                (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, 
                Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce</ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol><b>1.  </b>
            <b>Make the dough: </b>Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball.
            Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
        </ol>
        <ol><b>2.  </b>
            <b>Make the filling: </b>Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.
        </ol>
        <ol><b>3.  </b>
            <b>Make the sauce: </b>Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, 
            stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then
            whisk in the Parmesan.
        </ol>
        <ol><b>4.  </b>
            <b>Assemble the ravioli: </b>
            Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about 
            an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around 
            each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.
        </ol>
        <ol><b>5.  </b>
            <b>Cook and bake the ravioli: </b>Boil the ravioli in salted water until 
            the dumplings rise to the top and the filing is hot. Drain well.
        </ol>
        <ol><b>6.  </b>
            <b>Serve the ravioli: </b>Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the 
            warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.
        </ol>
    </p>
